# COVID-19 Outbreak Analysis in India

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak in India using data science and visual analytics techniques. The analysis includes data preparation, modeling, simulation, and visualization to understand the impact of best practices and preventive measures in managing the outbreak.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Mapplotlib.org**: For geographical visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis.
- **Excel**: For preliminary data examination and manipulation.

### Data Collection and Preparation

- Loaded and cleaned COVID-19 data using Pandas.
- Performed data preprocessing to calculate active cases and other relevant metrics.

### Data Analysis

- Grouped data by state and calculated the total number of confirmed, cured, deaths, and active cases.
- Sorted and filtered data to identify states with the least number of active cases.

### Visualization

- Created bar plots and line plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize COVID-19 trends.
- Generated geographical visualizations using MapColor.org to represent data on a map.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file `covid_19_india.csv` and `covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and visualization.

## Outcomes

- **Identified Trends:** Provided insights into COVID-19 trends across different states.
- **Visual Representation:** Created clear and informative visualizations to communicate data effectively.
- **Impact Assessment:** Assessed the effectiveness of preventive measures in managing the outbreak.
- **Resource Allocation:** Helped in understanding the allocation of health resources based on active cases.
